    Evaluate the zero-shot learning model using a similarity matrix and optional ground truth labels.
    Parameters:
    similarity_matrix_test (numpy.ndarray): A square matrix where each element represents the similarity score between test samples.
    y_test (numpy.ndarray, optional): Ground truth binary labels for the test samples. Default is None.
    threshold (float, optional): threshold value for determining positive predictions based on similarity scores. Default is 0.65.
    Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing the following evaluation metrics:
        - accuracy (float or None): Accuracy of the predictions if y_test is provided, otherwise None.
        - precision (float or None): Precision of the predictions if y_test is provided, otherwise None.
        - recall (float or None): Recall of the predictions if y_test is provided, otherwise None.
        - f1 (float or None): F1 score of the predictions if y_test is provided, otherwise None.
        - roc_auc (None): Placeholder for ROC AUC score, currently not implemented and always returns None.
