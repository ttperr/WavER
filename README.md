# Entity Resolution Internship Project @ Wavestone

This project has been done by **Tristan PERROT at Wavestone** for the course **DA250X - Degree Project in computer science at KTH**. The goal of this project is to implement an entity resolution solution based on several algorithms and to compare them.

## Installation

This project is a Python project. To install it, you need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

The libraries used in this project are in the [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) file. To install them, you can run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The datasets used in this project can be downloaded with the [`import_data.py`](import_data.py) python script. More information on the benchmark can be found [here](https://data.dws.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/benchmarkmatchingtasks/).

To download a dataset, you can run the following command:

```bash
python import_data.py --dataset <dataset_name>
```

## Usage

Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

<!-- ## Support

Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap

If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README. -->

<!-- ## Contributing

State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser. -->

<!-- ## Authors and acknowledgment

Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License

For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status

If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers. -->

## Suggestions for a good README

Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.
